📁 Wazuh — Historical Evidence (Deprecated)
Context

Wazuh was initially evaluated as a host-based security monitoring solution during the early design and setup phases of Iron Watch 02.

During this phase, Wazuh components (agent, manager, and dashboard) were deployed and tested to assess log collection and host visibility capabilities within the lab environment.

Reason for Deprecation

As Iron Watch 02 progressed, operational complexity and stability considerations led to a strategic decision to consolidate detection efforts into Graylog as the primary SIEM platform for this operation.

This change allowed for:

Simplified log ingestion

Clearer detection logic

Faster iteration on alerting and correlation

Reduced architectural overhead for the current scope

Scope of This Evidence

The artifacts contained in this directory represent:

Initial tooling evaluation

Early host-level visibility experiments

Architectural exploration during lab design

⚠️ Important Note
Wazuh artifacts are not part of the final detection workflow for Iron Watch 02 and did not contribute to the alerts or conclusions documented in this operation.

Current Detection Authority

All detection, alerting, correlation, and conclusions for Iron Watch 02 are based exclusively on Graylog telemetry.

Wazuh evidence is retained for documentation and learning purposes only.
